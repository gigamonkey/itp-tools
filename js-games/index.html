      <p>This game is designed to help you make sure you understand four of the main value types in Javascript:
      numbers, strings, booleans and arrays and the operators that operate on them.</p>
      <p>You will be presented with a question in the from of a Javascript expression with a hole that you need to fill
      in marked with <span class="hole">???</span>, an arrow, and to the right of the arrow the value that the
      expression should evaluate to. Below the question will be buttons containing values that you can use to fill the
      hole in the expression. Click the button that you think will cause the expression to evaluate to the desired
      value.</p>
      <p>If you choose a correct value (and sometimes there may be more than one) the question will briefly display the
      expression with your value filled in and a âœ… and then it will move on to a new question.</p>
      <p>If you choose a value that does not work, you will get a message about why it is not the right answer and you
      will be able to pick a different value.</p>
      <p>To see a log of all your answers, click the <img alt="list icon" height="14" src="list.svg" width="14"> icon
      above. You can click it again to hide the log. N.B. the log and your score are reset if you close or reload the
      page.</p>
      <p>Note also that this game takes a stricter view of what types cane be used with what operators that Javascript
      actually does. Since Javascript was originally designed to be used for small enhancements on web pages, its
      designers designed it to be forgiving and to try to make sense even of not entirely sensical programs. Thus it
      converts values from one type to another in many contexts allowing expressions like <span class="mono">10 *
      "123"</span> since it can interpret the string <span class="mono">"123"</span> as the number <span class=
      "mono">123</span>. But in this game you are expected to provide values of the actual appropriate types, without
      relying on any automagic conversion happening under the covers.</p>
