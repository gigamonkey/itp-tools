      Welcome to your first programming exercise. We are going to walk through
      this together in class so don't worry about not yet knowing what to do.
      After this exercise quickly introduces a few topics, we’ll go back and
      actually talk about each of them in more detail.

            Our goal is to make an animation of a bouncing ball. Because this is
            a first exercise, I’ve done some of the work for you. Behind the
            scenes this page has already loaded some code that has set up the
            image you see below and has defined several functions and variables
            that we’ll use to make the animation. (What are functions and
            variables, you ask? Stay tuned and all will be explained!)

            The area below is called a REPL which is an acronym for Read Eval
            Print Loop. You can type in Javascript expressions there and it will
            evaluate them and print the results. This can be handy for doing small
            experiments to understand your code. Try clicking in the REPL and then
            when the cursor shows up, typing something like <code>1 + 2</code> and
            hitting return.
