            Welcome to your first programming exercise. We are going to walk
            through this together in class. The point is mostly to give you your
            first (?) taste of programming.
          </p>

          <p>
            The goal is to make an animation of a bouncing ball. Because this is a
            first exercise, I’ve done some of the work for you. Behind the scenes
            this page has already loaded some code that has set up the image you
            see below and has defined several functions and variables that we’ll
            use to make the animation. (What are functions and variables, you ask?
            Stay tuned and all will be explained!)
          </p>

          <p>
            The panel to the left is a code editor&mdash;a place where you can
            edit the code of your program. I will give you some specific things to
            type in there until you get a sense of how things work. You can click
            the <svg class="bi" fill="#000">
              <use xlink:href="img/bootstrap-icons.svg#arrow-clockwise"/></svg>
            icon below the editor to run your code at any time. But pay attention
            to the area to the left of that icon: if there are certain kinds of
            errors in the code, it will complain about them there.
          </p>

            The area below is called a REPL which is an acronym for Read Eval
            Print Loop. You can type in Javascript expressions there and it will
            evaluate them and print the results. This can be handy for doing small
            experiments to understand your code. Try clicking in the REPL and then
            when the cursor shows up, typing something like <code>1 + 2</code> and
            hitting return.
