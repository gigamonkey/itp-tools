          Welcome to your first programming exercise. We are going to walk
          through this together in class. The point is mostly to give you your
          first (?) taste of programming.
        </p>

        <p>
          The goal is to make an animation of a bouncing ball. Because this is a
          first exercise, I’ve done some of the work for you. Behind the scenes
          this page has already loaded some code that has set up the image you
          see below and has defined several functions and variables that we’ll
          use to make the animation. (What are functions and variables, you ask?
          Stay tuned and all will be explained!)
        </p>

        <p>
          The panel to the left is a code editor&mdash;a place where you can
          edit the code of your program. I will give you some specific things to
          type in there until you get a sense of how things work. You can click
          the <svg class="bi"
          fill="#000"><use xlink:href="img/bootstrap-icons.svg#arrow-clockwise"/></svg>
          icon below the editor to run your code at any time though pay
          attention to the area to the left of that icon: if there are certain
          kinds of errors in the code, it will say something about them there.
        </p>
