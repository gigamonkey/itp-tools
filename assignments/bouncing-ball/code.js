//
// drawShadow(size, darkness) - draws an elliptical shadow on the ground below
// the ball at the given size and darkness.
//
// drawBall(height, size) - draws the ball at the given height and size.
//
// now() - returns the current time in milliseconds.

// Implement this in terms of drawShadow(), drawBall() and the functions below.

// as the time value that is passed in is just the current time, i.e. the same
// thing we would get from calling now().

// Compute the size of the shadow.
const shadowSize = (h) => 0;

// Call the animate function from the framework.
