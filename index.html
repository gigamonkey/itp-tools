      <p>This game is designed to help you make sure you understand four of the
      main value types in Javascript: numbers, strings, booleans and arrays and
      the operators that operate on them.</p>
      <p>You will be presented with a question in the from of a Javascript
      expression with a hole that you need to fill in marked with <span class=
      "hole">???</span>, an arrow, and to the right of the arrow the value that
      the expression should evaluate to. Below the question will be buttons
      containing values that you can use to fill the hole in the expression.
      Click the button that you think will cause the expression to evaluate to
      the desired value.</p>
      <p>If you choose a correct value (and sometimes there may be more than
      one) the question will briefly display the expression with your value
      filled in and a âœ… and then it will move on to a new question.</p>
      <p>If you choose a value that does not work, you will get a message about
      why it is not the right answer and you will be able to pick a different
      value.</p>
      <p>To see a log of all your answers, click the <img src="list.svg" alt=
      "list icon" width="14" height="14">icon above. You can click it again to
      hide the log. N.B. the log is reset if you close or reload the page.</p>
      <p>Note also that this game takes a stricter view of what types cane be
      used with what operators that Javascript actually does. Since Javascript
      was originally designed to be used for small enhancements on web pages,
      its designers designed it to be forgiving and to try to make sense even
      of not entirely sensical programs. Thus it converts values from one type
      to another in many contexts allowing expressions like <span class=
      "mono">10 * "123"</span> since it can interpret the string <span class=
      "mono">"123"</span> as the number <span class="mono">123</span>. But in
      this game you are expected to provide values of the actual appropriate
      types, without any automagic conversion happening under the covers.</p>
