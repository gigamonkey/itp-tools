  <h1>Intro to Programming</h1>

  <p>
    Welcome to Berkeley High’s <i>Intro to Programming</i> class.
  </p>

  <p>
    This website consists of a number of tools you will use to do some of your
    first assignments for this class. We’ll go over getting set up in the first
    day or two of class but the main thing you need to do
    is <a href="https://github.com/signup">sign up for a free GitHub account</a>
    if you don’t already have one. (If you do already have one, I’d encourage
    you to use it but if you’d rather create a new account just for this class
    that’s fine too.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you've set up your GitHub account you can look at the tools here. Or if
    you haven't you can still play with them but you won't be able to save your
    work.
