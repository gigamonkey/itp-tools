- Change REPL to work on multiple branches and possibly multiple files within a
  branch.

- Finish new-repl and replace REPL with it.

- Write function to check that you're ready to go: logged into GitHub, repo
  exists, and repo well formed.

- Use netlify \_rewrite rule
  (https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/rewrites-proxies/) to have a
  single page that handles all branches

- Make version of bouncing ball that has the code in an editor.

- Move "Saving" indicator into web page.

- Show SHA subtly somewhere in web page.

- Make set of files to load data driven.

- Factor repl.js into some modules.

- Figure out how to be robust (or at least graceful) if token stored is
  sessionStorage has been revoked. (Probably if any API requests file clear the
  current token from sessionStorage and then redirect to login.)
