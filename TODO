- Deal with array out of bounds rather than returning undefined.

- Disable wrong answers and let them try a different answer.

- Show all the values that would have worked.

- Better commentary when expected answer is array and the given answer
  is an array but the element at the index is not the right type.

- Maybe add a version where the answers are just types.

- Add scrore board.

- Add some kind of animation on selecting the answers.

- Possibly hide the log and only display on request and maybe only
  ones that were wrong.

- Show what wrong answers would have evaluated to (or that they
  wouldn't because of a type mismattch.)

- Add expressions in answers (e.g. 3 + 2 could be the answer to 6 >
  ??? ==> true).

- Actually use leveling, adjust it upwards when enough questions are
  answered correctly.

- Add variables somehow. Possibly just a table of variable values and
  then some answers are variable names.

- Maybe display log like a REPL: show the expression with the answer
  filled in, then what it evaluates to or "Type error" with some
  explanation. And maybe then the correct expression and what it
  evaluates to.
