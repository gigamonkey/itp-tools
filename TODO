- Reorganize (no pun intended) around putting student repos into Github organization.

- Popup to warn about not being logged in.

- Build test case assignment based on my Replit tester.

- Sort out logged out storage situation or rip it out. Goal should be to at
  least allow evaluating new code while logged out. Maybe not necessary to save
  it. (In fact no point in saving it unless we actually then save it all when
  logged in. Which seems maybe too complicated.)

- Fix styling (again) to keep everything on the page.

- Finish new-repl and replace REPL with it.

- Show stack traces (see error.stack also
  https://github.com/stacktracejs/stacktrace.js)

- Support multiple files in a project/assignment.

- Move "Saving" indicator into web page.

- Write function to check that you're ready to go: logged into GitHub, repo
  exists, and repo well formed.

- Show SHA subtly somewhere in web page.

- Figure out how to be robust (or at least graceful) if token stored is
  sessionStorage has been revoked. (Probably if any API requests fail, clear the
  current token from sessionStorage and then show logged out state.)

# Maybe not.

- Use netlify \_rewrite rule
  (https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/rewrites-proxies/) to have a
  single page that handles all branches
