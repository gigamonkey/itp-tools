- Wire up "Use anonymously" to hide banner.

- Add back a small GitHub icon in the toolbar to enable login from the logged out state.

- Figure out how to easily put common login code an every assigment, demo, and
  project page.

- Wire up info icon in top-toolbar to show something useful.

- Look into setting branch protection rule on main.

- Popup to warn about not being logged in.

- Add README to itp-template

- Move itp-template into gigamonkeys org

- Rename gigamonkeys org or make new one.

- Build test case assignment based on my Replit tester.

- Sort out logged out storage situation or rip it out. Goal should be to at
  least allow evaluating new code while logged out. Maybe not necessary to save
  it. (In fact no point in saving it unless we actually then save it all when
  logged in. Which seems maybe too complicated.)

- Fix styling (again) to keep everything on the page.

- Finish new-repl and replace REPL with it.

- Show stack traces (see error.stack also
  https://github.com/stacktracejs/stacktrace.js)

- Support multiple files in a project/assignment.

- Move "Saving" indicator into web page.

- Write function to check that you're ready to go: logged into GitHub, repo
  exists, and repo well formed.

- Show SHA subtly somewhere in web page.

- Figure out how to be robust (or at least graceful) if token stored is
  sessionStorage has been revoked. (Probably if any API requests fail, clear the
  current token from sessionStorage and then show logged out state.)

- Someday, should probably figure out if this thing should really be a GitHub
  App for finer grained permissions plus maybe the ability to do stuff in the
  org that the user doesn't have permission to do.

# Super polish

- Make the clipboard icon move a bit when you press it.


# Maybe not.

- Use netlify \_rewrite rule
  (https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/rewrites-proxies/) to have a
  single page that handles all branches
