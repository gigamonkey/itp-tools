        Welcome to <i>Intro to Programming</i>. If you are a student in the
        class, the first thing you need to do (and which we should have done in
        class) is set up your GitHub account.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once you have a GitHub account, click “Log in to GitHub” below to
        proceed. Or you can click “Use anonymously” to play with the environment
        but you will not be able to save your work or submit assignments. (You
        can always log in later by clicking the <svg class="bi"

        the top of the page.

        If you don’t have a GitHub account yet, please create one and then log
        in here for further instructions.

        Congratulations! You have successfully connected this app to GitHub.
        However you are not yet a member of the GitHub organization for this
        class, something Mr. Seibel needs to set up for you.

        This is your GitHub profile URL:

        I see you are logged into GitHub and a member of the <i>Intro to
          Programming</i> GitHub organization. However there seems to have been
        some problem finishing the setup for your account. Please let Mr. Seibel
        know.

        This is a tool for the <i>Intro to Programming</i> class at Berkeley
        High School. It is intended to provide a simple environment for
        experimenting with Javascript without all the complexities of a full
        development environment such as ReplIt or Glitch which we may use later
        in the year.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is also designed to take advantage of the browser’s ability to run
        Javascript natively. It does not need access to a server to run code
        making in extremely responsive even if the Wifi is flaking out.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, under the covers it is saving work to a GitHub repository in a
        very simplified workflow that does not depend on immediately learning
        any git commands. Code written in this environment for each assignment
        is saved to a directory and branch specific to that assignment each time
        it is saved. Thus when the assignment is done, it is easy to go to
        GitHub and create a PR containing just the work on that assignment which
        can then be commented on and worked on further before it is turned in
        and merged to main.

      This is a simple environment for experimenting with Javascript. The panel
      on the left is a code editor where you can define functions and variables.
      The panel on the right is called a REPL, which is an acronym for Read,
      Eval, Print Loop. You can type Javascript expressions in the REPL and hit
      return and it will evaluate them and print the resulting value. If you are
      logged in, changes you make in the editor will be saved.
