      Welcome to <i>Intro to Programming</i>. If you are a student in the
      class, the first thing you need to do (and which we should have done in
      class) is set up your GitHub account.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once you have a GitHub account, click “Log in to GitHub” below to
      proceed. Or you can click “Use anonymously” to play with the environment
      but you will not be able to save your work or submit assignments. (You
      can always log in later by clicking the <svg class="bi"

      the top of the page.

      in here for further instructions.

      Congratulations! You have successfully connected this app to GitHub.
      However you are not yet a member of the GitHub organization for this
      class, something Mr. Seibel needs to set up for you.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is your GitHub profile URL:

      I see you are logged into GitHub and a member of the <i>Intro to
        Programming</i> GitHub organization. However there seems to have been
      some problem finishing the setup for your account. Please let Mr. Seibel
      know.

      This is a tool for the <i>Intro to Programming</i> class at Berkeley
      High School. It is intended to provide a simple environment for
      experimenting with Javascript without all the complexities of a full
      development environment such as ReplIt or Glitch which we may use later
      in the year.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is also designed to take advantage of the browser’s ability to run
      Javascript natively. It does not need access to a server to run code
      making in extremely responsive even if the Wifi is flaking out.
    </p>

      Finally, under the covers it is saving work to a GitHub repository in a
      very simplified workflow that does not depend on immediately learning
      any git commands. Code written in this environment for each assignment
      is saved to a directory and branch specific to that assignment each time
      it is saved. Thus when the assignment is done, it is easy to go to
      GitHub and create a PR containing just the work on that assignment which
      can then be commented on and worked on further before it is turned in
      and merged to <code>main</code>.
